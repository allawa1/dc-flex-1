Implement the following without using a while or a for loop.

Acronym

Write a function named `acronym` that takes in an array of words as an argument and returns the acronym of the words. Use the `reduce` method to do this.

For example, calling `acronym(['very', 'important', 'person'])` should return _VIP_.

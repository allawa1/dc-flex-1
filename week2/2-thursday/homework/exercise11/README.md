n times

Write a function named `callNTimes` that takes in two parametersâ€“ an integer which represents the number of times the passed-in callback will fire and a callback that prints _Hello world!_.

For example, calling `callNTimes(5, hello)` should print the following to the console:
```
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
```

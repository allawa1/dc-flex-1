# Instructions

Using the command line on your own machine, create the directory structure shown below and populate each file with text. Remember that `~` refers to your home folder. Be aware that it is also common to write out the word _some_ followed by a string which is then placed in between angle brackets (e.g. `<someName>`) to indicate dynamic text. When you see this, come up with any string you like.

### STEP 1: Create a file tree
|-- ~
    |-- digitalcrafts
        |-- projects
            |-- cli101
                |-- hello.txt
            |-- mysite
                |-- index.html
            |-- files
                |-- question1.txt
                |-- question2.txt
                |-- question3.md
                |-- <someCompany>.info
                |-- remove-me-1.txt
                |-- remove-me-2.txt

### STEP 2: Now add some text
1. Place the words _hello world_ into **hello.txt**
2. Place the string `<html></html>` into **index.html**
3. Insert answers to the following questions into the 3 **question** files
    * What is your name?
    * What is your quest?
    * What is your favorite color?
4. Lastly, append why your quest is important to you to **question2.txt** without deleting the content you create earlier.

        Grandma's Knittery was founded by four strangers on the internet, built
        with nothing but a short conversation and a few smiles. Through hard
        work and perseverence the site was built in a matter of hours and has
        becaome an overnight success, catering to small, old lady knitters
        across the globe.

            Rudy is our master of Style, having studied textiles with the
            sherpas and wizened wise women of Nepal. Dreaming of llamas and the
            tufty clouds of the Himalayas, he can often be found perusing the
            markets of bangladesh in search of the perfect silk yarn. He also
            manages all of our branches with steadfast knowledge and a loving
            hand.

          Ben is our director of admissions to our coven of world class
          knitters. Raised by parents who were the owners of a prominant nursing
          home chain in Southern Iowa, he got his Masters Degree in elderly lady
          communications from the University of Saskatchewan, while completing
          side coursework in underwater basket weaving.

          Having travelled extensively throughout Peru and the lower hemisphere
          in search of the perfect pair of socks, Stacey is our head of
          operations. She is the heart of our design department, pulling
          inspiration for all our site from all over the world.

          Heather is our head of security, protecting all your files and
          knitting patterns with her trusty banjo she stole from Jack Kerouac
          back in the early 1960s. Clearly the oldest of our team, she provides
          safety for millions of of biddies executing large scale "knitting
          bombs", decorating unsuspecting cities from Vietnam to Argentina.

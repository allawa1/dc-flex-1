        Grandma's Knittery was founded by four strangers on the internet, built
        with nothing but a short conversation and a few smiles. Through hard
        work and perseverence the site was built in a matter of hours and has
        become an overnight success, catering to small, old lady knitters
        across the globe.

              Rudy is our master of Style, having studied textiles with the
              sherpas and wizened wise women of Nepal. Dreaming of llamas and the
              tufty clouds of the Himalayas, he can often be found perusing the
              markets of bangladesh in search of the perfect silk yarn. He also
              manages all of our branches with steadfast knowledge and a loving
              hand.

# Digital Crafts Flex Class Wiki

This repository is for students of the DC online flex cohort which commenced in July 2020. This is where we help each other complete in-class and homework assignments by posting solutions and improving upon them.

## Contributions
1. Always make sure that you have the latest code before starting.
```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```
2. Create a new branch where you will work. Name your branch following this format `<yourName>/<someExercise>`.
```
git checkout -b <yourName>/<someExercise>
```
3. Verify that you are on the branch you just created with `git branch`.
4. Add your answer or otherwise make the modifications you feel are necessary.
5. Push your branch to the repository (make sure you are in the directory where you have been working first).
```
git add .
git commit -m "<someMessage>"
git push origin <theNameOfTheBranchYouCreatedInStep2>
```
6. Submit a pull request and add @samuraijane, @DanStough, or @selenestica as a reviewer.
7. Repeat steps 1 â€“ 6 if you want to move to a new exercise.

## Guidelines
You are welcome to propose changes to existing answers but please include a comment with your PR that explains the improvement. If you add an answer to a challenge that already has one or more answers, place your code at the end of the file but precede it with a comment that identifies you with your GH handle. If a you wish to give an answer to a challenge that has none, remember that you will need to create the file for it first. The filename will always be `exercise<someNumber>.<someExtension>` where the number is the same as the folder within which the file is contained. If you have any question, reach out to us on Slack.

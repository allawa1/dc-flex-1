    <h1>This example is about making lists</h1>
    <body>
        <p>Here's what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool.</li>
        </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:
            <ol>  
                <li>Decided if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>if it's an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curveball!You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You've got this, I beleive in you!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
